# EasyShop

## Description of the Project

EasyShop is an API of a online store. The goal is to manage the functionalities that we've come to expect when we shop online. Most of the code was pre-built, but my additions made it so users could search for products by price range, category, or color. It also handles authentication of users, to see if they are an Admin, and allow them to add/update/delete categories or products, following CRUD operations.

## User Stories

- As a User, I want to be able to view products organized by category, so that I can see what products are available within said categories.
- As a User, I want to be able to set minimum and maximum price ranges, so that I can find products that fit my budget.
- As a User, I want to be able to search for products by color, so I can find what fits my tastes.
- As an Owner, I want to be able to add, update, and remove categories, so I can easily manage my inventory online.
- As an Owner, I want to be able to add, update, and remove products, so I can keep my inventory up to date.
- As a Developer, I want the API to require proper authentication, so that the system is more secure, and random people can't mess with the system.
- As a User AND an Owner, I want any errors that show up to be meaningful, so that I can understand what went wrong.
- As a User, I want the interface to be friendly, welcoming, and easy to navigate.

## Setup
